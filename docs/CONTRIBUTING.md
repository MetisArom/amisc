## Contributing to `amisc`
You might be here if you want to:

- Report a bug
- Discuss the current state of the code
- Submit a fix
- Propose a new feature
- Write unit tests
- Add to the documentation

We use [Github](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to host code and documentation, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## Submitting pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (bug fixes, new features, docs, etc.)

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`. Follow the general branch naming convention of `username-type-issue#` (e.g. `eckelsjd-bugfix-1`).
If you are adding a feature or making major changes, first create the [issue](https://github.com/eckelsjd/amisc/issues). "Type" is something like `bugfix` or `feature`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add a [test](https://github.com/eckelsjd/amisc/tests).
3. If you've made major changes, update the [documentation](https://github.com/eckelsjd/amisc/docs).
4. Ensure the test suite passes (coming soon).
5. Make sure your code lints (coming soon).
6. Issue that pull request!

We strongly recommend using [pdm](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) to set up your development environment. See the link for install details.
